# ingester

This is an attempt at a Linux version of ImageIngester (http://basepath.com/site/detail-ImageIngester.php)

**Use this at your own risk**

I have used this now for ~2000 images and all is good, but it is **very, very alpha** and has only limited copying features.  None of the awesome that is part of the real ImageIngester is here.

If you have a Windows or MacOS box, buy the proper thing from the link above - don't cheap out on your photos, or you will regret it!
